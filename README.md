ATS Resume Expert is a web-based tool built with Streamlit that evaluates resumes against job descriptions using Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model. It helps job seekers improve their chances of getting shortlisted by analyzing their resumeâ€™s format, content, relevance, and match percentage.

This tool simulates how an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) would screen resumes, and provides smart feedback on improvements, missing keywords, formatting suggestions, and project recommendations.

## ðŸ§  Why This Matters

Many candidates are rejected before a human ever sees their resume. Applicant Tracking Systems scan for keywords and structure, and if the resume isn't aligned with the job description, it's filtered out.

This app helps users:

- Evaluate if their resume matches the job description
- See their resume match percentage and get improvement tips
- Identify missing skills, tools, or keywords
- Improve resume format (font, sections, structure)
- Get personalized project suggestions to enhance their profile

It provides job seekers with a fast, AI-powered way to optimize resumes and boost interview chances.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works (Under the Hood)

1. User uploads their resume (PDF)  
   The app converts the first page of the PDF into an image for Gemini to analyze.

2. User pastes the job description  
   Gemini uses the job description along with the resume image to generate responses.

3. User selects an option:
   - Resume review and feedback
   - Match percentage and ATS simulation
   - Formatting improvement suggestions
   - Project recommendations based on the job role

4. The app displays Gemini's structured response with actionable feedback
